## Inspiration

Navigating college courses can be overwhelming, especially for first-generation and non-traditional students who lack clear guidance. We wanted to create a platform that simplifies this process, using AI to provide personalized recommendations that empower students to make informed choices and enhance their educational experience.

## What it does

Akta.life is an AI-driven platform that serves as a personalized course hub. It analyzes individual learning preferences, academic history, and career goals to recommend courses and professors tailored to each student’s unique needs. Users can access detailed insights on course expectations, professor teaching styles, and success rates, helping them find the best fit and avoid mismatches that can lead to academic setbacks.

## How we built it

We developed Akta.life using React and a robust AI recommendation engine. We leveraged data on course structures and professor profiles to build an algorithm that delivers targeted recommendations. The platform also integrates accessibility features to cater to diverse learning backgrounds.

## Challenges we ran into

A first-time hackathon is challenging. Learning how to assign roles and delegate tasks was time-consuming. Understanding how to correctly set up an idea that would deliver a solid value proposition to our target audience of students was difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We’re proud of developing an accessible, intuitive platform that demystifies the course selection process. Our beta testing showed high user satisfaction, with many students reporting an improved sense of confidence and preparedness in their academic choices. We’re also proud of creating a culturally meaningful brand that resonates globally.
## What we learned

We learned how students can further accelerate their learning with guided support tools. Coming from the perspective of college freshman, we've been put head first through the challenges of missing the nuances expressed my academic advisors on college life and how to manage our time. We hope that Akta can be a utility to empower students beginning their educational journey in higher ed.

## What's next for Akta.life

We plan to expand Akta.life’s reach to include more institutions and integrate resources like peer mentorship and academic support links. Future updates will enhance the recommendation engine with predictive analytics, empowering students with real-time insights into the best paths for achieving their goals.
